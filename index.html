               balancing asana is said to require concentration and grace; it is used in 
               the Indian classical dance form Bharatanatyam. The actor Mariel Hemingway
                describes Natarajasana as "a beautiful pose with tremendous power", comparing 
                the balance and tension in the arms and legs with an archery bow, and calling 
                it "a very difficult pose to hold."The pose is entered from standing in Tadasana,
                 bending one knee and stretching that foot back until it can be grasped with the 
                 hand on that side. The foot can then be extended back and up, arching the back and
                  stretching out the other arm forwards. For the full pose and a stronger stretch,
                   reverse the rear arm by lifting it over the shoulder, and grasp the foot</p>

               is a seated twisting asana in hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise. The full form
                is the difficult Paripurna Matsyendrasana. A common and easier variant is Ardha 
                Matsyendrasana. The asana has many variations, and in its half form is one
                 of the twelve basic asanas in many systems of hatha yoga.One foot is placed flat on the floor 
                 outside the opposite leg, and the torso twists towards the top leg. The bottom leg may be bent with 
                 the foot outside the opposite hip or extended with toes vertically. The arms help lever the torso into the twist, 
                 and may be bound in a variety of configurations by clutching either a foot or the opposite hand.</p>

             <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The pose is entered from Tadasana. 
               The most common form has one knee bent and the foot of that leg placed on
                the inner thigh of the standing leg; alternatively, the bent leg may be placed 
                in half lotus position. The hands are held above the head, either pointed directly 
                upwards and unclasped, or clasped together in anjali mudra.Vrikshasana is derived from
                 the Sanskrit term which combines Vriksha and position Vriksha means Tree, and Asana means posture. 
                 Vrikshasan or the Tree pose is a lovely meditation which integrates our body, mind and breath . 
                 This implores the qualities of mercy, generosity, flexibility, tolerance, strength, endurance, balance and 
                 grace which helps an individual to achieve overall growth in his or her life. As rightly mentioned in the Brahma
                  Samhita, which is an ancient book where Lord Brahma instantly composed poetic praises for the supreme divinity.</p>

                                <p>Yoga is a spiritual discipline that focuses on harmonizing the mind and body. 
                                   It is an art and science of healthy living. The word ‘Yoga’ comes from the 
                                   Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to yoke’ or ‘to unite’. </p>

                                   can know what we already know and be who we already are.”</p>
